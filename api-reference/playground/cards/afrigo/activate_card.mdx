api: "POST https://waas-card-middleware-api-staging.embedly.ng/api/v1/cards/afrigo/activate"
description: "This endpoint is to be used in activating an afrigo card issued to a customer."
---

<Warning>
When activating cards on behalf of your customers, ensure that the CARD NUMBER is passed in the format `first 6 digits ****** last 4 digits` and PIN chosen by the customer is **encrypted before sending via API**.

üîê **Encryption Standard**

- **Algorithm:** RSA
- **Key:** Contact the admin to obtain the RSA public key for production use
- **Padding:** PKCS#1 v1.5
- **Encoding:** UTF-8 for input, Base64 for output

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes**

- Always pass the Card number as a partially masked value (first 6 digits, 6 stars and last 4 digits).
- Always use the **latest RSA public key** shared by the platform.
- Do **not** attempt to decrypt the PIN ‚Äî only the platform (with its private key) can do so.
- Use PKCS#1 v1.5 padding, not OAEP.

**Example**

```csharp
public static string Encrypt(string userPin, string publicKeyContent)
{
	using var rsa = RSA.Create();

	// Try PEM format first, then raw base64
	try
	{
		rsa.ImportFromPem(publicKeyContent);
	}
	catch
	{
		// Handle raw base64 key
		var keyBytes = Convert.FromBase64String(publicKeyContent);
		rsa.ImportRSAPublicKey(keyBytes, out _);
	}

	var dataBytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(userPin);
	var encrypted = rsa.Encrypt(dataBytes, RSAEncryptionPadding.Pkcs1);
	return Convert.ToBase64String(encrypted);
}
```
