description: "This endpoint is to be used in activating an afrigo card issued to a customer."

<Warning>
When activating cards on behalf of your customers, you must follow the rules below to ensure data security and compliance.

**Card Number Format**

- Always pass the card number in a partially masked format:
  First 6 digits + 8 asterisks (\***\*) + last 4 digits**
  Example: `123456********7890`

**Encryption Standard**

- **Algorithm:** RSA
- **Key:** Contact the admin to obtain the RSA public key for production use
- **Padding:** PKCS#1 v1.5
- **Encoding:** UTF-8 for input, Base64 for output

**Important Notes**

- Only send the masked card number — never transmit the full card number.
- The PIN must always be encrypted using the platform’s RSA public key before sending via API.
- Do not attempt to decrypt the PIN — decryption is performed only by the platform using its private key.
- Always ensure you are using the latest RSA public key provided by the platform.

**PIN Encryption Example**

```csharp
public static string Encrypt(string userPin, string publicKeyContent)
{
	using var rsa = RSA.Create();

	// Try PEM format first, then raw base64
	try
	{
		rsa.ImportFromPem(publicKeyContent);
	}
	catch
	{
		// Handle raw base64 key
		var keyBytes = Convert.FromBase64String(publicKeyContent);
		rsa.ImportRSAPublicKey(keyBytes, out _);
	}

	var dataBytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(userPin);
	var encrypted = rsa.Encrypt(dataBytes, RSAEncryptionPadding.Pkcs1);
	return Convert.ToBase64String(encrypted);
}
```
