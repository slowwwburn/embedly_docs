# API Reference & Overview

Welcome to the Embedly API documentation! This page provides everything you need to integrate with the Embedly API, including setup instructions, authentication details, and detailed endpoint documentation with interactive playgrounds to test your requests.

## Get Started

### Retrieve Your API Key

To access the full Embedly API services, you’ll need an API key. Follow these steps to retrieve it from your dashboard:

1. **Log into Your Dashboard:** Visit [your dashboard URL](https://dashboard.embedly.com) and sign in with your credentials.
2. **Navigate to API Integration:** Go to the "API Keys" section in the sidebar.
3. **Generate a New Key:** Click "Generate API Key" to create a new key for your application.
4. **Copy Your API Key:** Save the generated key securely—you’ll need it for all API requests.

<Info>
	The APIs on the staging environment are currently open and do not require an
	API key for authentication. For testing purposes, you can use the default key
	`BSK-ONJx5zqEZ8M4RSEF3t1DVFPYQqvU22T54pdfzKm6xixaqVQ74gvTc63YTXmDdf2okVcPd6iSDWJm,
	AdminTest(For Currency & Organization API) and
	'BSK-GB9S3Ln7FUfGL1pWAOYDvLYnGyGeLRwfZ5A6e9pdTo6S8Xac25SAHp9VtNXeknMTtp50ncNyRezW`(For
	nin-kyc for the customer). This is subject to change with prior notice, so we
	recommend using your own API key to prepare for production. Use
	02600494-1a3c-11f0-a818-6045bd97b81d as your OrganizationId for test.
</Info>

### Base URLs

Use the following base URLs for your API requests:

- **Staging Environment:**  
  https://waas-staging.embedly.ng/api/v1

- **Production Environment:**  
  https://waas-prod.embedly.ng/api/v1

<Warning>
	Ensure you’re using the correct base URL for your environment. Requests to the
	production environment require a valid API key.
