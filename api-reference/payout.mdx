## Overview

Our Payout APIs allow you to seamlessly transfer funds out of your ecosystem to accounts across financial institutions directly from your platform. Whether you're sending loan disbursements, vendor payments, salary payouts, or refunds, our APIs support secure and efficient transfersâ€”including interbank, intra-bank. With real-time processing, and transaction status tracking, you can automate and scale your payout operations while delivering a smooth, reliable experience to your end users.

## How Does It Work?

<ol>
	<li>
		Initiating a Transfer Request: To start a transfer, you need to specify the
		account you want to send money from, the account you want to send money to,
		and the amount you wish to transfer. You can also add a short note to
		explain the reason for the transfer.
	</li>
	<Info>
		Account numbers for wallets can be retrieved using the get wallet details
		endpoint. However to reduce the amount of api calls you need to make, you
		should store the account number for each wallet once the wallet is
		successfully created.
	</Info>
	<li>
		Checking Transfer Status: After a transaction has been successfully
		initiated, you can check to see if it's been completed. The status will let
		you know if the transfer is still processing, if it's been processed
		successfully, or if there was an issue.
	</li>
</ol>
