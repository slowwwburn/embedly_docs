## Overview

Webhooks allow your system to receive real-time updates from our platform. Instead of constantly checking (polling) for updates, we notify your system as soon as something happens — like a payment being made or a user completing a form.

It’s like getting a text message when a delivery arrives, instead of refreshing the tracking page every 5 minutes!

---

## How It Works

1. You give us a webhook URL (an API endpoint on your server).
2. We send a `POST` request to that URL when a payment is made.
3. You process the transaction data on your end — e.g., mark an order as paid.

Here is simple example of a webhook URL

```json
app.post('/webhooks', (req, res) => {
  const event = req.body;
    // Handle the event
  res.status(200).send('OK');
});
```

## Sample Notification Payload

Whenever a wallet account receives a credit, your webhook endpoint will receive a JSON payload as seen below;

```json
{
	"AccountNumber": "9710003075",
	"transactionReference": "100004250517071546132898381664",
	"TransactionAmount": 2000.0,
	"Fee": 0.0,
	"SenderName": "John Doe",
	"SenderBank": "Sterling Bank",
	"DateOfTransaction": "2025-01-01T00:00:00",
	"Source": "NIP",
	"Description": "Transfer from Mary Wilson",
	"DC": "C"
}
```
