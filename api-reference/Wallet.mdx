	Please note that this service can only be used to manage wallets created by
	you as an orgnisation

## Wallet types

### Open Wallet

Open Wallets function similarly to traditional bank accounts. They support full transaction capabilities, including movement of funds to and from external financial institutions.

#### Common use-cases

<ul>
	<li>Receiving funds into an Embedly wallet</li>
	<li>Send funds to other wallets across platforms</li>
	<li>Initiating **payouts** to external bank accounts</li>
	<li>Atm withdrawals, POS payments and Online payments</li>
</ul>

#### Flow

```

									[Create Customer]
											|
											v
								[Verify KYC - NIN / BVN]
											|
											v
								[Create customer Wallet]
									|				|
									v				v
				[Intra-Wallet Transfer]		 [Payout to Bank Account]
```

### Closed Wallet

Closed Wallet are restricted to **internal transactions** within your own ecosystem or embedly's ecosystem.

<Warning>
	Closed wallets do not support sending funds to external bank accounts or
	third-party wallets. However, they can be funded from any traditional nigerian
	account.
</Warning>

Closed Wallets are ideal for use cases where value is stored, exchanged, or redeemed **exclusively** within the boundaries of your platform. Since funds never leave the system, Closed Wallets are exempt from KYC requirements on production, making them easier to implement and manage.

#### Common use cases

<ul>
	<li>Loyalty or rewards systems</li>
	<li>E-commerce wallets</li>
	<li>In-app value storage (e.g. points or tokens)</li>
</ul>

#### Flow

```
								[Create Customer]
       									|
       									v
								  [Add Wallet]
       									|
       									v
						[Fund Wallet via Third-Party App]
      									|
       									v
							[Wallet-to-Wallet Transfer]
```

### Merchant Profiling & Environment Behavior

By default, on the **production environment**, every customer you create must be KYC-verified up to **at least Tier 1** before you can create a wallet for that customer.

> Even after KYC and wallet creation, **payout transactions** will remain restricted unless your organization is profiled for the appropriate wallet type.

To enable **wallet payout transactions** or to **exempt individual customer KYC requirements** (for Closed Wallets), your organization must be explicitly profiled for either an **Open** or **Closed** wallet.

---

### 📩 How to Request Wallet Profiling

To get profiled, send an email with the details below:

#### ✅ Email Details

- **To:** `support@embedly.ng`
- **Subject:** `Wallet Profiling Request – Open or Closed`

#### ✉️ Include the following in your email body:

- Your **Organization Name**
- Your **Organization ID**
- Desired **Wallet Type**: `Open` or `Closed`

  > On **staging**, customer KYC is required to create wallets. However, all wallets can be used to test payout endpoints **without needing to request wallet profiling via email**.
