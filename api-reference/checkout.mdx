### Checkout APIs

Embedly Checkout service enable you to create temporary wallets that let customers securely transfer funds into your ecosystem. These wallets are ideal for scenarios like order payments, ticketing, donations, or any situation where you need to collect funds without provisioning a permanent wallet.

Each checkout wallet is:

- **Time-bound** – Expires after a set period
- **Event-driven** – Created in response to a specific action or event

This approach enhances security, minimizes risk, and gives you greater control over the transaction flow.

## Tips for Using the Service

- Initiate Just-in-Time: Only create checkout wallets when the customer is ready to make a payment, since each wallet expires 30 minutes after creation.

- Track with Metadata on Your Side: Maintain a mapping between your internal references (like order ID or customer ID) and the wallet in your system for reconciliation.

- Monitor for Expiry: If the customer hasn’t paid within the 30-minute window, you’ll need to generate a new checkout wallet. Consider setting up automated reminders or fallback actions.

- Regularly Sync Wallet Status: Use the Get All Checkout Wallets endpoint to check for payments, expired wallets, or unused entries to keep your records up to date.
