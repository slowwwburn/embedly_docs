## Overview

Our Checkout APIs let you generate temporary, one-time-use wallets that allow your customers to transfer money into your ecosystem securely and easily. These wallets are ideal for use cases such as order payments, ticketing, donations, or any instance where you want to collect funds from users without creating permanent wallets. Each checkout wallet is designed for a single transaction flow and are time-bound and event-driven to enhance control and reduce risk.

## Tips for Using the Service

- Initiate Just-in-Time: Only create checkout wallets when the customer is ready to make a payment, since each wallet expires 30 minutes after creation.

- Track with Metadata on Your Side: Maintain a mapping between your internal references (like order ID or customer ID) and the wallet in your system for reconciliation.

- Monitor for Expiry: If the customer hasn’t paid within the 30-minute window, you’ll need to generate a new checkout wallet. Consider setting up automated reminders or fallback actions.

- Regularly Sync Wallet Status: Use the Get All Checkout Wallets endpoint to check for payments, expired wallets, or unused entries to keep your records up to date.
