# How to Use These Codes

<Note>
Understanding and properly handling response codes is critical for building reliable and user-friendly applications. Below are some key considerations for using these codes in your application logic.
</Note>

- **00 (Approved or completed successfully):** Indicates that the transaction was successful. Your application can proceed as expected.

- **01 (Status unknown):** The transaction status is currently unknown. You should wait for the settlement report to confirm the final status.

- **03, 05, 06, 07:** These codes typically indicate issues with the sender or the sender's account, such as invalid credentials or a dormant account.

- **09 (Request processing in progress):** The request is still being processed. You may need to poll or wait for a final status.

- **12, 13, 14, 15:** These codes indicate issues with the transaction details, such as an invalid amount, transaction type, or record ID.

- **51 (No sufficient funds):** The sender’s account does not have enough funds to complete the transaction. This will typically require action on the sender's part.

- **57, 58, 61:** These codes are related to transaction permissions and limits, such as exceeding withdrawal limits or attempting a restricted transaction.

- **94 (Duplicate transaction):** This indicates that the transaction has already been processed. Ensure that your application is not unintentionally duplicating requests.

- **96, 97:** These codes suggest technical issues such as a system malfunction or timeout. These often require retrying the request or investigating the system status.

# Best Practices

<Tip>
Implement robust error handling in your application to manage different response codes effectively. This includes retry mechanisms, user notifications, and logging for future analysis.
</Tip>

- **Handling Errors:** When you receive an error code, it’s important to implement appropriate error handling in your application. This could involve retrying the transaction, alerting the user, or logging the error for further investigation.

- **Logging:** Keep logs of all response codes for auditing purposes. This can help in troubleshooting issues and improving the reliability of your application.

- **User Feedback:** For codes that indicate user action is required (e.g., insufficient funds), ensure that your application provides clear and actionable feedback to the user.

- **System Monitoring:** Regularly monitor your transactions for codes like 96 (System malfunction) or 97 (Timeout), as these can indicate underlying issues that need to be addressed promptly.
