## Introduction

Before diving into the specifics, let's clarify the key terms used within the Edge platform:

## Key Terms

| SN  | Term                          | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| :-- | :---------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1   | **Virtual Account**           | A passthrough account that cannot hold value on its own but serves as a collection conduit for businesses.                                                                                        |
| 2   | **Dedicated Virtual Account** | Permanently assigned to a customer, this type of virtual account can be used repeatedly, similar to a regular deposit account but without the ability to hold value.                              |
| 3   | **Dynamic Virtual Account**   | A virtual account designed to expire after certain conditions are met, such as a specified time period or the collection of a designated amount.                                                  |
| 4   | **Pool Account**              | An internal account, accessible only via the Edge platform, used as a funds holding account for all virtual accounts created by you.                                                              |
| 5   | **Transaction Wallet**        | Generated upon Go Live, this wallet is funded by you to cover fees for certain API services on Edge, such as transfers and KYC. Edge fees are deducted from this account as you transact.         |
| 6   | **Revenue Wallet**            | Also generated upon Go Live, this wallet functions as your revenue account. Funds from successful transactions are remitted here once Edge facilitates the charge of revenue.                     |
| 7   | **Corporate Account**         | Your regular corporate account where funds from your pool account are swept into upon instruction. Withdrawals from your transaction wallet and revenue wallet are also credited to this account. |

## Corporate Account Profiling

During your organization's profiling, you'll be required to either provide a Sterling corporate account or have one generated for you.

## Creating Your First Set of Accounts

Upon going live, the system automatically generates the following types of accounts for you:

1. **Pool Account**
2. **Transaction Wallet**
3. **Revenue Wallet**

After successfully going live, you can start issuing other types of accounts, such as Virtual (Fixed/Disposable) Accounts, Personal Accounts, or Corporate Accounts, depending on the services you signed up for and regulatory compliance.

### Why is a Sterling Corporate Account Required?

A Sterling corporate account ensures ultra-fast processing and seamless integration with the Edge platform, providing immediate access to re-indexed documentation and services.

### What if I Already Have a Sterling Account?

If you already own a Sterling account, the system will integrate it, allowing you to enjoy features like light and dark modes for content and component display.

## Interactive API Playground

The Edge platform includes an Interactive API Playground, allowing users to explore and test endpoints directly.

## Developer Community Support
