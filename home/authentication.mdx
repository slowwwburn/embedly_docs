<Warning>
  You must also always pass in the **headers** of all your api request the correct api key as `x-api-key: {{you api key}}` based on the environment you are calling.
</Warning>

## Base URL

When making API requests, you'll need to use the appropriate base URL depending on the environment:

- **Production Environment:**\
  Use this URL for live, production-level operations:

  ```http
  https://waas-prod.embedly.ng/api/v1
  ```
- **Sandbox environment:**\
  Use this URL for testing and development purposes. The sandbox environment mirrors the production environment but is intended for safe testing without affecting real data:

  ```http
  https://waas-staging.embedly.ng/api/v1
  ```

<Info>
  Ensure that you are using the correct base URL for your environment to avoid unintended data manipulation or errors. For testing, always start with the sandbox environment before moving to production.
</Info>

<Warning>
  For security reasons, ensure that your token is stored securely and never shared publicly. Tokens should be refreshed regularly to maintain secure access to the API.
