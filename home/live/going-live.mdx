Before taking your application live in the Embedly production environment, it’s essential to complete several **pre-going live activities**. These steps ensure that your integration is secure, compliant, and fully tested, preventing issues when handling real data and transactions.

## Pre-Going Live Checklist

<Steps>

  <Step title="1: Finalize API Integration in Staging">
    Before going live, ensure that your **API integration** is fully tested in the staging environment. The staging mirrors the production environment but uses mock data, allowing you to test without affecting live systems.

    <Info>
      Run through all key API calls—like creating customers, creating wallets, processing payments, and querying data—to ensure your integration behaves as expected. Pay close attention to **authentication**, **error handling**, and **data validation**.
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="2: Conduct Security Audits">
    Security is paramount when going live. Ensure your system meets industry-standard security practices, such as:

    - **API Key management:** Safeguard your API keys, using secure storage and regular rotation.
    - **Authentication:** Ensure secure authentication mechanisms are in place for users and administrators.

    <Warning>
      Failing to secure your integration can lead to data breaches, unauthorized access, and service disruptions. Perform regular security audits to safeguard sensitive information.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="3: Complete KYC and Compliance Requirements">
    Embedly requires all merchants to complete **Know Your Business (KYB)** and **compliance checks** before moving to production. Ensure that:

    - You have provided accurate information about the business and its representatives.
    - All required documents (such as government-issued IDs and business certificates) are uploaded.
    - Your business is compliant with regional regulations (e.g., GDPR, PCI DSS).
  </Step>

  <Step title="4: Set Up Production API Key">
    Once you’ve tested your integration in the staging, it’s time to switch to the **production environment**. To do this, you’ll need to:

    - Retrieve your **production API key** from the Embedly Dashboard.
    - Update your application’s configuration to use the production base URL and keys.

    <Warning>
      Do not use staging keys in the production environment. Make sure to update your credentials to production API keys before going live.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="6: Enable Real-Time Monitoring and Alerts">
    When your application goes live, it’s critical to have real-time monitoring and alerts set up to track transactions and system health. Ensure that:

    - You’ve enabled **alerts** for errors, failed transactions, or system downtime.
    - You have **transaction logging** enabled to monitor API requests, response times, and errors.

  </Step>

  <Step title="7: Prepare for Post-Go-Live Support">
    Ensure you have a support plan in place for post-launch activities. This includes:

    - **User support:** A strategy to handle customer inquiries and troubleshoot issues.
    - **Technical support:** A team ready to handle technical issues with API integration, authentication, or transaction processing.
    - **Monitoring ongoing compliance:** Ensure ongoing regulatory compliance and be ready to address new requirements.

    <Info>
      Staying proactive about customer and technical support can prevent disruptions and help maintain user trust post-launch.
    </Info>
  </Step>

</Steps>
