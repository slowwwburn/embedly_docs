## Security Best Practices

<Steps>

  <Step title="1. Secure API Key Management">
    **API keys** are used to authenticate your requests to Embedly, and it’s crucial to handle them securely:

    - **Store Tokens Securely**: Use environment variables or a secure vault for storing your api key. Avoid hardcoding api key directly into your codebase.
    - **Rotate your API Regularly**: Periodically rotate your api key to reduce the risk of unauthorized access.
    - **Limit API key Scope**: Issue your api key with the minimum permissions necessary for your use case.

    <Warning>
      If an api key is exposed or compromised, refresh it immediately through the Embedly Dashboard to prevent unauthorized access.
    </Warning>

  </Step>

  <Step title="2. Implement Strong User Authentication">
    Ensure that both internal users (e.g., administrators) and external users (e.g., customers) are authenticated securely:

    - **Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Require MFA for all admin access to the Embedly Dashboard.
    - **Enforce Strong Passwords**: Implement password policies that require a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters.
    - **Monitor Login Attempts**: Track failed login attempts and consider implementing account lockout mechanisms to prevent brute-force attacks.

    <Tooltip tip="Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide more than one verification factor to access their accounts.">

    <Warning>
      Weak authentication can expose your integration to unauthorized access. Always require strong passwords and MFA for secure access.
    </Warning>

  </Step>

  <Step title="3. Monitor and Log API Activity">
    Regularly monitoring your API activity helps you detect and respond to suspicious behavior:

    - **Enable API Logs**: Use the Embedly Dashboard to enable detailed logging of API requests, responses, and errors.
    - **Set Up Alerts**: Create alerts for abnormal activities like repeated failed login attempts, unusual transaction volumes, or access from unknown IP addresses.
    - **Regularly Review Logs**: Perform periodic reviews of API logs to ensure that no unauthorized activity has occurred.

  </Step>

  <Step title="4. Implement Incident Response Procedures">
    Preparing for potential security incidents helps minimize the impact on your business and users:

    - **Define an Incident Response Plan**: Create a plan that outlines the steps to take if a security incident occurs, including whom to notify and how to contain the issue.
    - **Train Your Team**: Ensure that your team is trained on the incident response procedures and knows how to use the tools available for security monitoring.
    - **Conduct Regular Drills**: Run regular security drills to test your incident response plan and improve your team’s readiness.

    <Warning>
      A slow or ineffective response to a security incident can result in significant data loss and damage to your reputation.

## Security Tips for Developers

<Tip>
	Use environment variables or secure vaults for storing API keys and secrets,
	keeping them out of source code repositories.
</Tip>

<Tip>
	Regularly audit your API keys and user access levels to ensure that no
	unnecessary permissions are granted.
</Tip>

## Common Security Risks to Avoid

- **Exposed API key**: Accidentally exposing your api key in public repositories can result in unauthorized access to your API. Always use `.env` files or secure storage solutions.
- **Weak Authentication**: Not enforcing strong passwords or MFA can lead to unauthorized access. Implement robust authentication mechanisms for all users.
- **Failure to Monitor API Activity**: Without proper logging and monitoring, you may not detect unauthorized access until it’s too late. Always enable and review logs.

<Warning>
	Neglecting security practices can put your business and your users' data at
	risk. Always prioritize security when integrating with Embedly.
