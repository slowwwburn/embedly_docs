title: "Environment"
description: "When integrating with the Embedly API, understanding the different environments available is crucial for smooth development and deployment. Embedly provides two distinct environments—**Staging** and **Production**—each tailored for specific stages of your integration process. This guide will walk you through the purpose of each environment, how to use them effectively, and best practices for transitioning from testing to live operations."

### Staging Environment

<Accordion title="What is the Staging Environment?">
	The Staging environment is a safe, simulated version of the Embedly API,
	designed for testing and development. It mirrors the Production environment in
	terms of functionality and API behavior, but with one key difference: actions
	performed in the Staging do not affect real data or financial transactions.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why Use the Staging Environment?">
	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>Safe Testing:</strong> The Staging allows you to test your
			integration without the risk of impacting real users or data. You can
			freely experiment with API calls, validate your workflows, and
			troubleshoot issues in a controlled setting.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Development Flexibility:</strong> Use the Staging to build and
			refine your application, ensuring all API interactions function as
			expected before going live.
		</li>
	</ul>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How to Access the Staging Environment">
	To start using the Staging environment, direct your API requests to the
	following base URL:
	<CodeBlock language="http">https://waas-staging.embedly.ng/api/v1</CodeBlock>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Best Practices for Using the Staging">
	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>Test Thoroughly:</strong> Before moving to Production, ensure
			you’ve tested all possible scenarios in the staging, including Embedly
			cases and error handling.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Simulate Real-world Conditions:</strong> Mimic the conditions your
			application will face in Production as closely as possible to uncover
			potential issues early.
		</li>
	</ul>
</Accordion>

### Production Environment

<Accordion title="What is the Production Environment?">
	The Production environment is where your application interacts with real users
	and live data. Once your integration has been thoroughly tested in the
	Staging, you’ll transition to Production to begin live operations.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why Use the Production Environment?">
	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>Live Operations:</strong> This environment is for real
			transactions, data processing, and user interactions. Everything that
			happens here is part of your live service, affecting actual business
			operations.
		</li>
	</ul>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How to Access the Production Environment">
	Once you're ready to go live, switch your API requests to the following base
	URL:
	<CodeBlock language="http">https://waas-prod.embedly.ng/api/v1</CodeBlock>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Best Practices for Using the Production Environment">
	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>Ensure Readiness:</strong> Double-check that all tests have been
			completed in the Staging, and that your integration is fully prepared for
			live use.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Monitor Performance:</strong> Keep a close eye on your
			application’s performance in Production, particularly in the initial
			phase, to quickly identify and address any issues.
		</li>
	</ul>
</Accordion>

### Transitioning from Staging to Production

<Steps>
	<Step title="Final Testing in Staging">
		Perform a final round of testing in the Staging to ensure all functionality
		works as intended.
	</Step>

    <Step title="Update Configuration">
    	Modify your application’s configuration to point to the Production
    	environment URL. Ensure that api key and
    	environment-specific settings are updated accordingly.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Perform a Controlled Launch">
    	Consider rolling out your integration gradually in Production to monitor its
    	performance and make adjustments as needed.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Ongoing Monitoring">
    	After moving to Production, continue to monitor your integration closely,
    	particularly in the early stages of deployment.
    </Step>

</Steps>

### Important Considerations

<Warning>
	Remember that your API key is environment-specific. Ensure that you are using
	the correct api key for each environment to avoid authentication errors.
</Warning>

<Warning>
	Always store your api key securely and follow best practices for API security,
	especially in the Production environment.
</Warning>

<Warning>
	Keep in mind that data in the Staging is separate from Production. Actions in
	the Staging will not affect your live data or operations.
</Warning>
