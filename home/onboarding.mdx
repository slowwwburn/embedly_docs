    <Steps>
      <Step title="First Name and Last Name">
        Use alphabetic characters only, with an optional hyphen for double-barrelled names (e.g., "John-Paul").
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Company Name">

        **Select Your Country:** Begin by selecting the country where your phone number is issued from the dropdown list.  
        **Enter Your Local Number:** After selecting the country, type in your local phone number without the initial "0."
